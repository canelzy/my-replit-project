# Replit Access Fix - Domain Not Found Issue

## Problem
Chrome shows "not found" when accessing the Replit domain.

## Diagnosis
- Server is running locally on port 5000 ✅
- .replit configuration shows port mapping ✅
- Environment variables for REPLIT_URL are empty ❌

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Verify Replit Domain
Your domain should be accessible at:
`https://canada-services-hub-canelzy.replit.app`

### Step 2: Common Access Issues
1. **Replit Sleeping**: If the repl was inactive, it needs to "wake up"
2. **Port Configuration**: Must be configured to serve on 0.0.0.0:5000
3. **Public Access**: Repl needs to be public for external access

### Step 3: Quick Fixes
1. **Restart Repl**: Stop and start the repl to refresh domain
2. **Check Port**: Verify port 5000 is properly exposed
3. **Public Setting**: Ensure repl visibility is set to public

### Step 4: Alternative Access Methods
If domain issues persist:
1. **Use Replit Preview**: Click preview button in Replit
2. **Use Local Testing**: PWABuilder won't work but app functionality can be tested
3. **Deploy to Production**: Use Replit Deployments for stable domain

### Expected Behavior
When working properly:
- Domain loads your Canada Services Hub
- Manifest available at `/manifest.webmanifest`
- Service worker at `/service-worker.js`
- PWABuilder can analyze the site

The server configuration is correct - this appears to be a Replit domain access issue.
