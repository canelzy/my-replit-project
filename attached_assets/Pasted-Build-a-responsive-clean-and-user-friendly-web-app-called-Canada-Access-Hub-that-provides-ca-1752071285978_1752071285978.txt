Build a responsive, clean, and user-friendly web app called **"Canada Access Hub"** that provides categorized links to important Canadian government services.

**Features to include:**

1. **Homepage:**  
   - Welcome message and app description ("All your government links in one place.")  
   - Search bar that filters all links across categories dynamically

2. **Categories:**  
   Display these categories, each expandable/collapsible or on separate pages/tabs:  
   - Taxes & Benefits  
   - Pensions & Retirement  
   - Employment & Social Development  
   - Immigration & Citizenship  
   - Health & Disability  
   - Legal / Identification  
   - General Government

3. **Links List:**  
   For each category, show a list of links with:  
   - Title  
   - Short description  
   - Clickable link opening in a new tab  
   - Optional icon or logo

4. **Bookmark/Favorites:**  
   Allow users to save their favorite links using browser localStorage and view them in a dedicated "Favorites" section.

5. **Responsive UI:**  
   Use Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for styling. The app should work well on desktop and mobile.

6. **Optional:**  
   - Dark mode toggle  
   - Bilingual support (English/French)

**Use the following data structure for links:**

```js
const linksData = {
  "Taxes & Benefits": [
    { title: "CRA MyAccount", description: "Manage taxes online", url: "https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html" },
    { title: "Canada Child Benefit", description: "Child benefit info", url: "https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview.html" },
    // ... other links
  ],
  "Pensions & Retirement": [
    { title: "Canada Pension Plan (CPP) & OAS", description: "Public pensions", url: "https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions.html" },
    // ... other links
  ],
  // Add other categories similarly
};
Start with a single-page React app or vanilla JS app, whichever is easier, and make sure code is clean and modular.
