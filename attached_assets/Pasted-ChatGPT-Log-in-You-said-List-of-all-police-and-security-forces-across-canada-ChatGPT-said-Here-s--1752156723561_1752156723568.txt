Here's a clear and structured prompt you can use in Replit (or any code environment) to create a website that displays the list of police and security forces across Canada, including links and optional contact info:

‚úÖ Prompt for Replit (HTML + CSS + JavaScript website)
"Build a responsive website titled 'Canadian Police & Security Forces'. The homepage should list all categories of police and security forces in Canada: Federal, Provincial, Municipal, Indigenous, Transit/Transport, Conservation/Environmental, and Special Constables. Each category should have collapsible sections that reveal the agencies within it. Each agency should include a name, a brief description, and a link to their official website or contact page. Use simple, clean CSS styling with mobile support. Include a search bar to filter agencies by name. Also, provide a contact page with emergency and non-emergency links (e.g., 911, RCMP contact, CBSA tip line)."

üß± What This Will Create
A clean, categorized list of Canadian police/security agencies.

Expandable/collapsible sections for each type.

Links to official websites or contact forms.

A search bar to quickly find an agency.

A footer or contact page with emergency resources.

Would you like me to generate the base HTML/CSS/JavaScript files right now for use in Replit?
