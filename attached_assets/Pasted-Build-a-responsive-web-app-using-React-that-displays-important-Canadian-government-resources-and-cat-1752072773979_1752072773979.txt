Build a responsive web app using React that displays important Canadian government resources and categorized links to Ontario non-profits.

Features:
1. A section at the top titled "Key Official Directories & Databases" listing:
   - Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) Charity Listings with link and description
   - Ontario Not-for-Profit Corporations (ONCA) Registry with link and description
   - CharityVillage directory with link and description
   - Imagine Canada directory with link and description

2. Below that, display categorized lists of Ontario-based non-profits grouped by service area, such as:
   - Health & Disability Support
   - Immigration & Settlement Services
   - Housing & Homelessness Assistance
   - Financial & Legal Aid
   - Employment & Training
   - Family & Child Support
   - Senior & Pension Support
   - Education & Literacy
   - Environmental & Community Development

3. Each category section should show the organization name as a clickable link opening in a new tab, and a brief description underneath.

4. Implement a search bar at the top that filters organizations by name or category dynamically as the user types.

5. Use clean, mobile-friendly styling with clear headings and spacing.

6. Store the data for directories and non-profits in a JSON file or JavaScript object in the project for easy maintenance.

7. Bonus: Add a category filter dropdown so users can quickly jump to a specific category.

Deliver the app as a single-page React app, ready to deploy.

Use sample data including these directories and at least 3 organizations per category from Ontario as shown below:

Directories Example:
[
  {
    "name": "Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) Charity Listings",
    "url": "https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/hacc/srch/pub/dsplyBscSrch?request_locale=en",
    "description": "Official public database of registered charities in Canada."
  },
  ...
]

Non-profits Example for one category:
{
  "category": "Health & Disability Support",
  "organizations": [
    {

    ...
  ]
}
