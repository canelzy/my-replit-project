I need you to update my Replit project 'canadian-service-hub-canelzy' with the following changes for my app 'Canada Access Hub'. The project is hosted at https://canadian-service-hub-canelzy.replit.app, and the goal is to comply with Google Play Store's Misleading Claims policy by adding a disclaimer on the main page and creating a separate page with both the disclaimer and privacy policy.

1. **Update the Main Page (index.html)**:
   - Locate the folder containing the PWA files (likely 'public' or 'client') and open 'index.html'.
   - Add the following disclaimer at the top of the <body> section with prominent styling:
     <div style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff3f3; border: 2px solid #ffcccc; text-align: center;">
       <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
       <p>This app, Canada Access Hub, is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or representing any government entity, including the Government of Canada. It is a convenience tool designed to provide information and services to users. The content may include references to government sources (e.g., canada.ca) for informational purposes only. For official government services, please visit authorized websites such as canada.ca. Use of this app is at your own discretion, and we are not responsible for any inaccuracies or consequences arising from its use.</p>
     </div>
   - Below the disclaimer, add a link to the separate page: <p>Welcome to Canada Access Hub! <a href="/important-disclaimer.html">Read More (Privacy Policy & Disclaimer)</a></p>. Replace 'Welcome to Canada Access Hub!' with the existing content if it differs.
   - Preserve any existing head content (e.g., CSS links) and body content below the added sections.

2. **Create a Separate Page (important-disclaimer.html)**:
   - In the same folder as 'index.html' (e.g., 'public' or 'client'), create a new file named 'important-disclaimer.html'.
   - Add the following content:
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Important Disclaimer & Privacy Policy - Canada Access Hub</title>
       <style>
         body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 20px; line-height: 1.6; }
         h1 { color: #333; }
         .section { background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0; }
       </style>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Important Disclaimer & Privacy Policy - Canada Access Hub</h1>

       <div class="section">

         <p><strong>Last Updated: July 22, 2025</strong></p>

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
         <p>Welcome to Canada Access Hub, a Progressive Web App developed by GiolynxApps. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we handle your data.</p>

         <h3>Data Collection</h3>
         <p>This app does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users. We do not require login credentials or access to personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, or phone numbers.</p>

         <h3>Analytics</h3>
         <p>We may use third-party analytics tools (e.g., [specify tool if used]) to collect non-personal data, such as anonymous usage statistics (e.g., page views, session duration). This data is aggregated and used solely to improve the app’s functionality and user experience. No individual user tracking occurs.</p>

         <h3>Data Usage and Sharing</h3>
         <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to third parties. Any data collected (if applicable) is used exclusively for the purposes outlined above and is not linked to your identity.</p>

         <h3>Cookies and Local Storage</h3>
         <p>The app may use cookies or local storage to enhance functionality (e.g., offline access via service workers). These are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to external servers.</p>

         <h3>Security</h3>
         <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of data. However, no online transmission is fully secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

         <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
         <p>This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

         <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
         <p>We may update this privacy policy periodically. Changes will be reflected with an updated “Last Updated” date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.</p>

         <h3>Contact Us</h3>
         <p>For questions or concerns about this policy, please contact us at [insert email, e.g., support@giolynxapps.com].</p>
       </div>
     </body>
     </html>
   - Replace '[specify tool if used]' with the actual analytics tool (if any) and '[insert email]' with your contact email.

3. **Test the Changes**:
   - Run the project and visit https://canadian-service-hub-canelzy.replit.app to ensure the disclaimer appears at the top of the main page.
   - Click the 'Read More' link to confirm 'important-disclaimer.html' loads correctly.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - After testing, use PWABuilder[](https://www.pwabuilder.com) with the Replit URL to generate a new APK/AAB.
   - Sign the file with Android Studio and submit it to the Play Console with an updated store listing.

Please execute these changes and let me know if you encounter issues or need further assistance, such as specifying the email or analytics tool.
