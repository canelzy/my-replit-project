Create a web application on Replit that serves as a directory for important Canadian government services, organized into categories such as Taxes, Benefits, Pensions, and Other Services. Each category should contain clickable links to official Government of Canada websites, ensuring users can access trusted information.
Requirements:

Technologies: Use HTML and CSS for structure and styling. Optionally, use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for a modern, responsive design.
Structure: Create a main page with sections for each category (Taxes, Benefits, Pensions, Other Services). Each section should have a heading and an unordered list of links.
Links: Ensure all links open in a new tab (target="_blank"). Include the following key links, and add more relevant links from the Government of Canada services page (https://www.canada.ca/en/services.html) as needed.
Design: Include a header with the title "Canadian Government Services" and a brief description (e.g., "Access key government services for taxes, benefits, pensions, and more."). Add a footer with the text "Links are sourced from the Government of Canada. Last updated: July 9, 2025."
Responsiveness: Ensure the app is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Optional Features:
Add a search bar to filter links based on keywords.
Implement collapsible sections (e.g., using JavaScript or CSS) for each category to improve navigation.
Provide a contact form or email link for users to suggest new links or report issues.

Consider adding links to online accounts, such as My Account (CRA) (https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html) and My Service Canada Account (https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html).
If including provincial services, link to provincial government websites (e.g., Ontario: https://www.ontario.ca/, British Columbia: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/), but focus primarily on federal services unless specified.
Ensure the code is well-commented and maintainable, with placeholders for additional links.
