    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: July 22, 2025</strong></p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Canada Access Hub, a Progressive Web App developed by GiolynxApps ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our app. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and complying with applicable laws, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>

    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>We do not intentionally collect personal data such as names, addresses, email addresses, or phone numbers. However, the app may collect the following non-personal information to enhance functionality and user experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: Device type, operating system, browser type, and IP address (anonymized where possible).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Pages visited, session duration, and interaction data (e.g., button clicks), collected anonymously.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Storage Data</strong>: Cached data for offline access via service workers, stored locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use cookies that transmit data externally, but local storage may be used for app performance.</p>

    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the app's functionality and user experience.</li>
      <li>To analyze usage patterns and optimize performance (e.g., fixing bugs, enhancing features).</li>
      <li>To ensure compliance with legal obligations and protect against fraud or security threats.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your information for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>

    <h3>Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h3>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we may share non-personal, aggregated data with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: Third-party analytics tools (e.g., no external analytics currently used) to process usage data. These providers are contractually obligated to use the data only for our specified purposes and to maintain confidentiality.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not engage in cross-app tracking or share data with ad networks.</p>

    <h3>User Rights and Choices</h3>
    <p>You have the following rights regarding your information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access</strong>: Request details of any data we hold about you (if any).</li>
      <li><strong>Correction</strong>: Request correction of inaccurate data.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion</strong>: Request deletion of data, subject to legal retention periods.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-Out</strong>: Disable analytics collection if supported by the app (e.g., via settings, if implemented).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at the email below. Note that since we primarily collect non-personal data, these rights may have limited applicability.</p>

    <h3>Data Security</h3>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information, including encryption for data in transit (where applicable) and secure storage for any collected data. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. In case of a data breach, we will notify affected users and authorities as required by law.</p>

    <h3>International Data Transfers</h3>
    <p>If you are located outside Canada or the EEA, your data may be processed in Canada or the United States by our service providers. We ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR for EEA users, through standard contractual clauses where necessary.</p>

    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>Canada Access Hub is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we become aware of such collection, we will delete the data and terminate the account (if applicable). Parents or guardians should contact us to report any concerns.</p>

    <h3>Third-Party Links</h3>
    <p>The app may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., canada.ca). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.</p>

    <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. The "Last Updated" date will be revised, and we will notify you of significant changes via the app or email (if contact information is provided). Continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance of the new policy.</p>

    <h3>Compliance with Laws</h3>
    <p>We comply with PIPEDA in Canada and GDPR for EEA users, ensuring transparency, consent (where required), and data minimization. For California residents, we adhere to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), providing rights to know, delete, and opt-out of data sales (though no sales occur).</p>

    <p>For questions, concerns, or to exercise your rights, please contact us at Apps@Giolynx.org. You may also write to us at GiolynxApps, Toronto, ON, Canada.</p>
