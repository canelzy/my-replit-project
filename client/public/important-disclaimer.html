    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Canada Access Hub, a Progressive Web App developed by GiolynxApps. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we handle your data.</p>

    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
    <p>This app does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users. We do not require login credentials or access to personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, or phone numbers.</p>

    <h3>Analytics</h3>
    <p>We may use basic analytics to collect non-personal data, such as anonymous usage statistics (e.g., page views, session duration). This data is aggregated and used solely to improve the app's functionality and user experience. No individual user tracking occurs.</p>

    <h3>Data Usage and Sharing</h3>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to third parties. Any data collected (if applicable) is used exclusively for the purposes outlined above and is not linked to your identity.</p>

    <h3>Cookies and Local Storage</h3>
    <p>The app may use cookies or local storage to enhance functionality (e.g., offline access via service workers, user preferences). These are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to external servers.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of data. However, no online transmission is fully secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

    <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy periodically. Changes will be reflected with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.</p>
