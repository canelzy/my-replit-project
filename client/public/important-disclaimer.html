    <p><strong>Last Updated: July 22, 2025</strong></p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Information Access Hub, a Progressive Web App developed by GiolynxApps ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our app. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and complying with applicable laws, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>

    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p style="background-color: #fef3c7; border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; padding: 12px; border-radius: 4px;">Information Access Hub is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or representing any government entity, including the Government of Canada. It is a convenience tool designed to provide information sourced from official government websites (e.g., canada.ca). Use of this app is at your own discretion, and we are not responsible for any inaccuracies or consequences arising from its use. For official government services, please visit authorized sites such as canada.ca.</p>

    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>We do not intentionally collect personal data such as names, addresses, email addresses, or phone numbers. The app may collect the following non-personal information to enhance functionality and user experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: Device type, operating system, browser type, and IP address (anonymized where possible).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Pages visited, session duration, and interaction data (e.g., button clicks), collected anonymously.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Storage Data</strong>: Cached data for offline access via service workers, stored locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, no login credentials, personally identifiable information (PII), or location tracking occurs. We do not collect data from users under 13, ensuring child safety. Contact form data, if submitted, is used solely to respond to inquiries and is not stored or shared beyond that purpose.</p>

    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the app's functionality and user experience.</li>
      <li>Analyze usage patterns and optimize performance (e.g., fixing bugs, enhancing features).</li>
      <li>Ensure compliance with legal obligations and protect against fraud or security threats.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your information for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>

    <h3>Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h3>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or transfer your personal information to third parties. We may share non-personal, aggregated data with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: Third-party analytics tools (currently none in use) to process usage data, contractually bound to maintain confidentiality and use data only for our purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose information if required by law, regulation, or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not engage in cross-app tracking or share data with ad networks.</p>

    <h3>Data Security</h3>
    <p>All connections use HTTPS encryption to secure data transmission. We implement industry-standard security measures, including secure storage for any collected data and strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. In case of a data breach, we will notify affected users and authorities as required by law.</p>

    <h3>Analytics and Tracking</h3>
    <p>We do not use third-party analytics tools, cookies, or tracking technologies. Your browsing behavior is not monitored, ensuring a no-tracking experience.</p>
